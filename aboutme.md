I am an aquatic ecologist working at the intersection of bioassessment, environmental DNA (eDNA), and advanced modeling. 

I am a Research Scientist at Jonah Ventures, a commercial laboratory pioneering the sampling, processing, and analysis of eDNA. In 2022, I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Colorado Boulder with the Spaulding Lab, working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state scientists to develop bioassessment indices for Colorado streams and northeast lakes. Before that, I earned a PhD in 2020 from the University of Colorado Boulder with the McKnight and Spaulding Labs studying biogeography and changes in biodiversity of algae across U.S. and Antarctic streams. In 2013, I completed a M.S. from Florida International University working with the Gaiser Lab on the effects of phosphorus enrichment on benthic algae in the Florida Everglades.
